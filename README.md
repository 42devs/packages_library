# 42devs's Packages Registry

[[toc]]

All our collabs to packages registry, using a monorepo

## Installing Packages

```bash
# using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install  @42devs/[package name]@[version?]

# using yarn (deprecated, but some people are still using it :shrug:)
yarn install @42devs/[package name]@[version?]

# using npm
npm install @42devs/[package name]@[version?]

```

_remember to add `--save-dev` or `-D` if you need to use them on **devDependencies**_

## Packages Available

### Fetch - an native fetch wrapper

`@42devs/fetch`

This is for people who gonna miss axios, or a better solution to handle the request errors, with no extra packages!!!, check the readme on [fetch](/packages/fetch)

### Transbank SDK

`@42devs/transbank-sdk`

Yet another way to use the transbank sdk on nodejs, is a big WIP right now but we have roadmap now! and a couple of collaborators!
